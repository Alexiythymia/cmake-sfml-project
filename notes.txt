1) You don't need x11, or at least I don't seem to. The sfml window comes up on its own without any other shit on my wsl setup
2) You DO need to separately install all the sfml dependencies listed on the sfml startup with cmake documentation page, as well as libopenal-dev and libfreetype. Either cmake
build fails or make compilation fails without both of those.
